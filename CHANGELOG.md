## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Round 3: WavPack v.4 decorrelation sub-block expanders.
  `expand_terms` decodes the `0x02` payload into a
  `DecorrelationTerms { terms: Vec<i8>, deltas: Vec<u8> }`, one
  byte → one `(term, delta)` pair per the wiki "lower 5 bits
  indicate predictor type, high 3 bits contain delta value" rule.
  `expand_weights` decodes the `0x03` payload through the wiki's
  log-pack recipe (`n = getchar() << 3; if (n > 0) n += (n + 64) >> 7`
  with the byte read as signed) into a
  `DecorrelationWeights { weights: Vec<i32> }`. `expand_samples`
  reads the `0x04` payload as little-endian 16-bit words and applies
  the wiki exponent / mantissa expansion (mantissa signed; exponent
  biased by `-9`) into a `DecorrelationSamples { samples: Vec<i32> }`.
  Out-of-range shift counts on the sample expander saturate rather
  than panicking. A new `Error::DecorrelationSamplesOddByteCount`
  variant rejects malformed sample payloads whose byte count is not
  a multiple of two.
- 15 new unit tests (38 total): low-5/high-3 term-byte split across
  the full `0..=18` predictor range; multi-byte term order
  preservation; zero / positive-rounding / negative-no-rounding
  weight expansions and multi-byte order preservation; sample
  expansion for the `exponent == 9` / `< 9` / `> 9` branches with
  positive and negative mantissas; byte-pairing across multi-sample
  payloads; empty-payload handling for all three expanders;
  saturation behaviour for extreme exponents; rejection of odd-byte
  sample payloads.

- Round 2: WavPack v.4 metadata sub-block walker. `walk_metadata`
  consumes the post-header payload returned by
  `parse_block_header` and returns `Vec<MetadataSubBlock>`,
  driving `parse_metadata_sub_block` (also exposed for callers
  that want to validate against `ck_size` themselves). The
  `SubBlockId` enum names every documented sub-block ID listed in
  the wiki "IDs" section: `0x00..=0x0D`
  (`Dummy`/`DecorrelationTerms`/`DecorrelationWeights`/`DecorrelationSamples`/`EntropyInfo`/`HybridProfile`/`NoiseShapingProfile`/`FloatInfo`/`Int32Info`/`PackedSamples`/`PackedCorrectionData`/`PackedOverflowBits`/`MultichannelInfo`)
  plus `0x20..=0x27`
  (`RiffHeader`/`RiffTrailer`/`EncodingDetails`/`Md5Checksum`/`NonStandardSampleRate`).
  Undocumented IDs surface as `Unknown(u8)` rather than erroring
  (the wiki's `0x20` "decoder may ignore" flag is the forward-
  compat mechanism). `SubBlockFlags` decodes the structural flag
  triple (`0x20` optional / `0x40` odd-size / `0x80` large-size);
  the walker handles both the 1-byte and 3-byte (large-flag)
  size-field encodings, strips the trailing odd-size padding byte,
  and reports truncated input as `Error::Truncated`. Two new
  `Error` variants — `MetadataSubBlockTooLarge` and
  `MetadataOddSizeWithoutPayload` — cover the remaining structural
  rejections.
- 13 new unit tests (23 total): flag-triple decoding, the full
  18-entry round-trip through `SubBlockId::from_id_byte` /
  `as_id_byte`, small-format and large-format sub-block parsing,
  odd-size padding strip (small + large), back-to-back walk-to-
  exhaustion, RIFF-wrapper / non-standard-rate sub-block decode,
  unknown-ID acceptance, truncated-input rejection, and the
  zero-word-with-odd-flag rejection.

- Round 1: WavPack v.4 block-header parser. `parse_block_header`
  returns a typed `WavPackBlockHeader` (magic, ck_size, version,
  track_number, track_sub_index, total_samples, block_index,
  block_samples, flags, crc) plus the unconsumed payload tail. The
  32-bit flag word is decoded into a typed `Flags` view exposing
  every bit-range named on the wiki "Flags meaning" listing
  (bytes-per-sample, mono / hybrid / joint-stereo / cross-channel
  decorrelation / hybrid-shaping / float / int32 / hybrid-profile /
  multi-channel start-end markers / left-shift / max-magnitude /
  sampling-rate index / reserved bit 27 / robust / hybrid IIR
  noise-shaping / false-stereo / low-latency). Validates the
  `'wvpk'` magic, the `ck_size >= 24` minimum, and the
  `0x0402..=0x0410` version window. Sample decode, decorrelation,
  entropy and metadata-sub-block walking remain out of scope.
- 10-test unit suite covering the accept / reject boundaries of
  each header field plus an exhaustive bit-by-bit layout check
  on the flag word and a little-endian preamble check.

### Changed

- Clean-room rebuild from a fresh orphan `master`. The previous
  implementation was retired by the OxideAV docs audit dated
  2026-05-06; the prior history is preserved on the `old` branch.
  See `README.md` for the rebuild scope and the strict-isolation
  workspace the Implementer rounds will draw from.
